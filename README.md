## Usage

The module deploys a cognito user pool client. It's possible to set a full configuration (attention to the possible conflicts) and also the basic one, only passing the required variables.

## Example

```hcl
module "cognito_user_pool_client" {
  source = "./"
  USER_POOL_ID = module.cognito_user_pool.USER_POOL_ID
  CLIENT_NAME  = "example"
}
```
